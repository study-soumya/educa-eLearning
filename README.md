# Django E-Learning Platform

Welcome to the Django E-Learning platform, a cutting-edge online education platform designed to revolutionize the way we learn. Built with Django, a powerful Python web framework, this platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools for educators and learners alike.

## Project Overview

The Django E-Learning Platform is a dynamic educational platform that facilitates learning through structured courses, interactive content, and a user-friendly interface. It's designed to cater to both educators who want to share knowledge and learners seeking to expand their horizons.

### Key Components

* **Courses Management:** A robust system for creating, managing, and tracking courses.
* **Subjects Organization:** Allows for organizing courses under specific subjects for easy navigation and discovery.
* **User Authentication:** Securely manages user accounts with basic authentication.
* **Enrollment System:** Allow users to enroll in courses and track their progress.
* **Content Access:** Provide enrolled users with access to course contents and materials.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django 4.x - 5.x
- Redis (for caching)
- SQLite (as the default database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv env/educa
   ```
3. Activate virtual environment:

   `For windows`

   ```
   ./env/educa/Scripts/activate
   ```

   ```
   cd educa
   ```
4. Install the required packages:

   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Apply migrations to set up the database schema:

   ```python
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
6. Run the development server:

   ```python
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can start exploring the platform's features. Here are some key points to note:

* **Accessing the Admin Panel:** Use the Django admin panel to manage courses, subjects, and user accounts. Default credentials are provided in the documentation.
* **Enrolling in Courses:** Users can enroll in courses via the frontend interface. Enrollment requires authentication.
